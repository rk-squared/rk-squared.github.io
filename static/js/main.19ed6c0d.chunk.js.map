As a general rule, you should be very cautious in granting software the\n      ability to do this, and you should only do it with software you trust. (RK² is designed so\n      that it can only decrypt FFRK traffic, which should help with any security concerns. In\n      technical terms, it generates a private CA (certificate authority); then it uses that CA to\n      create and save a certificate for ffrk.denagames.com, so that it can decrypt FFRK traffic;\n      then it discards the CA key, so that it can't create certificates for any other sites.)\n    </p>\n\n    <h3>Known Issues</h3>\n\n    <p>\n      RK²'s information about soul breaks and legend materias is currently not automatically updated\n      outside of new releases; it's just a snapshot of whatever was available at its last release.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n      RK² currently only supports a single FFRK profile. So, for example, if you play both GL and\n      JP, you'll need to find a way to run two copies of RK² (for example, use two different\n      laptops, or two different PC accounts, or manually copy RK²'s config.json depending on which\n      profile you're playing).\n    </p>\n  </>\n);\n","import * as React from 'react';\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\n\nimport { hideMessage as hideMessageAction, Message } from '../actions/messages';\nimport MessageBox from '../components/MessageBox';\nimport { IState } from '../reducers';\n\ninterface Props {\n  messages: Message[];\n  hideMessage: (id: number) => any;\n}\n\nexport class MessagesList extends React.Component<Props> {\n  render() {\n    const { messages, hideMessage } = this.props;\n    const messageIds = Object.keys(messages).sort();\n    return (\n      <>\n        {messageIds.map(i => <MessageBox key={i} message={messages[+i]} onClose={() => hideMessage(+i)}/>)}\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default connect(\n  (state: IState) => ({ messages: state.messages.messages}),\n  {\n    hideMessage: hideMessageAction\n  }\n)(MessagesList);\n","import * as React from 'react';\n\nimport { Message } from '../actions/Messages';\n\ninterface Props {\n  message: Message;\n  onClose?: () => any;\n}\n\nexport default class MessageBox extends React.Component<Props> {\n  render() {\n    const {\n      message: { text, color },\n      onClose,\n    } = this.props;\n    return (\n      <div className={`alert alert-${color}`} role=\"alert\">\n        {onClose && (\n          <button type=\"button\" className=\"close\" aria-label=\"Close\" onClick={onClose}>\n            <span aria-hidden=\"true\">&times;</span>\n          </button>\n        )}\n        {typeof text === 'string' ? text : <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={text} />}\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n","// extracted by mini-css-extract-plugin\nmodule.exports = {\"component\":\"m2d5bLhVAbJJ8gpZBoC3i\",\"content\":\"HvagO--BXqnFHRa2LWZ0\",\"footer\":\"_3lludC_cOnMneW_EGSjNuG\"};","import * as React from 'react';\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux';\nimport { Dispatch } from 'redux';\n\nimport { loadDungeons } from '../actions/dungeons';\nimport { World } from '../actions/worlds';\nimport { IState } from '../reducers';\n\nimport { BrowserLink } from '../components/common/BrowserLink';\nimport { DungeonsList } from '../components/dungeons/DungeonsList';\nimport ItemTypeChecklist from '../components/dungeons/ItemTypeChecklist';\nimport LoadMissingPrompt from '../components/shared/LoadMissingPrompt';\nimport { progressKey } from '../sagas/loadDungeons';\nimport { Page } from './Page';\n\nconst styles = require('./DungeonsPage.scss');\n\ninterface Props {\n  worlds: {\n    [id: number]: World;\n  };\n  missingWorlds: number[];\n  dispatch: Dispatch;\n}\n\nexport class DungeonsPage extends React.Component<Props> {\n  handleLoad = () => {\n    const { missingWorlds, dispatch } = this.props;\n    dispatch(loadDungeons(missingWorlds));\n  };\n\n  render() {\n    const { worlds, missingWorlds } = this.props;\n    return (\n      <Page title=\"Dungeons\">\n        <LoadMissingPrompt\n          missingCount={missingWorlds.length}\n          missingText=\"Dungeons for %s have not been loaded.\"\n          countText=\"realm or event\"\n          countPluralText=\"realms and events\"\n          loadingText=\"Loading dungeons\"\n          onLoad={this.handleLoad}\n          progressKey={progressKey}\n        />\n\n        {worlds == null ?
